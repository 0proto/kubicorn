# kubicorn.io

Here is the content of the official `kubicorn` website: [kubicorn.io](kubicorn.io).

All documentation for the project is hosted in the [docs section](kubicorn.io/documentation/readme.html) of kubicorn.io

# Adding a new page

To create a new page on the website, create a new `.md` markdown file in `/docs/_documentation`.

All new docs must contain the header

```
---
layout: documentation
title: Building Kubicorn
date: 2017-08-19
doctype: general
---
```

Where `doctype` is the larger category for the documentation. All docs should be written in valid `.md` markdown.

# Editing existing documentation

Simply update the associated `.md` markdown file. All documentation should be in complete sentences.
